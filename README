Baked up at a Drupal Dojo in Boston.

== Installation ==
1. Assign the Permission "override background published option" to the Role you want in /admin/user/permissions
2. Same for "create background content" permission.
3. Set the Access Parameters in the View "Background Admin" to the desired Role. admin/build/views/edit/background_admin

Now users with role specified have permission to upload background nodes and your roles specified have access to admin/background to approve backgrounds.


== Credits == 
rjstatic - can take credit for the workflow aspect
Siavash of http://www.wewebworkers.com/ wrote some sweet code that rjstatic based some of this on.  In particular, the idea of using jQuery to apply the background image as opposed to patching themes.
